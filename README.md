A toolbox to help with all tasks around the interactive coding and measurement of occupations.

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("occupationMeasurement/occupationMeasurement")
```

## Usage

There are three main ways of using this package, with varying degrees of flexibility and convenience:

1. Use the included shiny `app()` which provides all functionality to run your own survey out-of-the-box.
2. Use the included JSON `api()` to use the package with your own survey-tool or application for maximum flexibility.
3. Use the R functions directly to implement your own custom functionality or package.

For a more detailed overview of the package refer to `vignette("occupationMeasurement")`.

### Using the interactive App

The interactive app can be started with the function `app()` function. 
More information about the interactive app can be found in `vignette("app")` and the help page `?app`.

```r
# Run the interactive shiny app
occupationMeasurement::app()
```

The app also supports custom questionnaires, so you can build your own or use one some of the questionnaires included in the package e.g. the `demo_questionnaire` will explain the functionality of the app using the code below.

```r
library(occupationMeasurement)

# Run the app with additional explanations
app(questionnaire = demo_questionnaire())
```

### Using the JSON API

If you want to include this package in your custom survey-tool or app or if you just need higher flexibility, you can use the included `api()`.

The api server can be started by simply running the code below, opening its included documentation by default.

More information about the API can be found in `vignette("api")` and the help page `?api`.

```r
# Start the API (and open its documentation)
occupationMeasurement::api()
```

### Using the Exported R Functions

As this is an R package you can also use the functions within it directly. This way you can integrate it into your codebase, extend its functionality or even use it in your own R package.

If you want to, for example, generate some suggestions for a certain text input you can do so by just running the code below:

```r
library(occupationMeasurement)

# Generate some job suggestions
get_job_suggestions("Koch", num_suggestions = 3)
```

There are of course many other functions available as well, to check them out, just take a look at the function reference section in the documentation.

## Development

### Testing

The included tests can be run with the following snippet.

```r
devtools::test()
```

It is recommended to also run a more detailed check via the following snippet.

```r
devtools::check()
```

### Formatting

After making changes to the code, it is advised to automatically format all code with the {styler} package. This can be done with the following snippet.

```r
styler::style_pkg()
```

### Documentation

The documentation website is powered by {pkgdown}. It can be rebuilt with the following snippet. 

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

To set up everything for hosting the documentation on github pages use `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`.

During development, `roxygen2::roxygenise()` is useful to update .Rd-files.
