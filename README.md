A toolbox to help you with all tasks around the coding and measurement of occupations.

[[online demo](https://occupationmeasurement.shinyapps.io/app_demo/)[^1]]

[^1]: Demo for `questionnaire_demo()` running on shinyapps.io. Alternative demos for `questionnaire_web_survey()` [[demo](https://occupationmeasurement.shinyapps.io/app_web/)] and `questionnaire_interviewer_administered()` [[demo](https://occupationmeasurement.shinyapps.io/app_interviewer/)] are also available. Demos may be unavailable due to bandwidth restrictions.

## About

Coding people's occupations into official classifications such as the [International Standard Classification of Occupations ISCO-08](https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/) or [German KldB-2010](https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/DE/Navigation/Grundlagen/Klassifikationen/Klassifikation-der-Berufe/Archiv-KldB/KldB2010/KldB2010-Nav.html) is a notoriously difficult problem. This toolbox is designed to make this easier, by helping with many of the tasks surrounding the measurement of occupations: From creating a survey and collecting data all the way to retrieving the final coded responses.

For a detailed overview of the package refer to `vignette("occupationMeasurement")` or take a look at `browseVignettes("occupationMeasurement")` to see a list of vignettes describing the package. All vignettes are also available in the [online documentation](https://occupationmeasurement.github.io/occupationMeasurement/index.html).

## Installation

Prerequisites:

- The [R Statistical Software](https://www.r-project.org/) (Version 4.1 or higher)
- The R package [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) to install packages from github, available via `install.packages("remotes")`

The package can then be installed by running the code below:

```r
remotes::install_github("occupationMeasurement/occupationMeasurement")
```

## Usage

### Using the interactive App

The interactive app is the easiest way to use the package: It provides a fully-featured, interactive survey application to collect and immediately code occupational data. Starting it is as easy as calling the `app()`-function.

More information about the interactive app can be found in `vignette("app")` and the help page `?app`.

```r
# Run the interactive shiny app
occupationMeasurement::app()
```

The app also supports custom questionnaires, so you can build your own or use and adapt one of the questionnaires included in the package. E.g., the `questionnaire_demo()` will explain the functionality of the app, and `questionnaire_interviewer_administered()` is designed to be read by interviewers in [CATI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_telephone_interviewing) and [CAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_personal_interviewing) surveys. The `questionnaire_web_survey()` is intended to be used for internet surveys.

```r
library(occupationMeasurement)

# Run the app with additional explanations. The best way to get started.
app(questionnaire = questionnaire_demo())

# Run the app in interviewer-administered ...
app(questionnaire = questionnaire_interviewer_administered())
# or online surveys
app(questionnaire = questionnaire_web_survey())
```

### Alternative Usage

Besides the interactive app, there are also two alternative ways of using this package, with varying degrees of flexibility and convenience:

1. Use the included JSON `api()` to use the package with your own survey-tool or application for maximum flexibility.
2. Use the R functions directly to implement your own custom functionality or package via e.g. `get_job_suggestions()`.

You can find more information on how to use these functionalities in `vignette("occupationMeasurement")`.

## Package Development

This section is only relevant when further developing the package itself.

### Testing

The included tests can be run with the following snippet.

```r
devtools::test()
```

It is recommended to also run a more detailed check via the following snippet.

```r
devtools::check()
```

### Formatting

After making changes to the code, it is advised to automatically format all code with the {styler} package. This can be done with the following snippet.

```r
styler::style_pkg()
```

### Documentation

The documentation website is powered by {pkgdown}. It can be rebuilt with the following snippet. 

```r
pkgdown::build_site()
```

To set up everything for hosting the documentation on github pages use `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`.

During development, `roxygen2::roxygenise()` is useful to update .Rd-files.
